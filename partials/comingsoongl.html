Guest Lectures have always been an integral part of Kurukshetra. These lectures are a portal for the knowledge-seeking to access the true visionaries of our time and to widen their scope of thought. Witness the growth of revolutionary ideas, real-time demonstrations, and interact with the stalwarts.
